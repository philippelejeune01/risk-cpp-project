Changed IssueOrder(this method will have to be implemented from scratch in assignment 3,just made sure both players of the pair issue orders)
Added bool isEmpty to Class OrdersList to facilitate execution of orders.
Implemented exceuteorderphase, loops on each players orderlist till its empty,
however some of the orders(blockade for example) causes the program to crash, please investigate.
